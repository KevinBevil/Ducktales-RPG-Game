Ducktales RPG Game

This Ducktales themed RPG game allows you to choose a character and a defender, then you attack the defender with a certain attack point magnitude, and the defender counter attacks with a certain counter-attack magnitude.  If your health points drop to or below 0, then you lose.  If the defender's health points drop to or below 0, then another defender is chosen.
